ðŸš€ Feature Breakdown
This section outlines the key features of the Airbnb Clone project, explaining their roles in delivering a complete property rental experience.

1. User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts securely. This feature ensures personalized access for both hosts and guests, with role-based functionality and secure password handling.

2. Property Management
Registered users (hosts) can list their properties by providing details such as title, description, location, price, and photos. This feature allows property owners to showcase their rental offerings and manage availability.

3. Booking System
Guests can view property details and make reservations for specific dates. This feature handles booking validation, date conflict prevention, and booking status updates (e.g., confirmed, cancelled).

4. Review System
Guests can leave ratings and written reviews after staying at a property. This helps maintain trust within the platform and allows hosts to improve based on user feedback.

5. Payment Integration
Users can make secure payments for bookings using supported payment methods. This feature tracks transactions and ensures that bookings are financially verified.

6. Search and Filtering
Users can search properties by location, price range, availability, and other filters. This makes it easy to find suitable listings quickly and efficiently.

7. Responsive Frontend Design
The platform is designed to work seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. A clean, user-friendly interface enhances the overall user experience.


API Security
Securing the backend APIs of the Airbnb Clone project is essential to protect user information, property data, and payment integrity. The following security measures are implemented to safeguard the platform:

ðŸ”‘ Authentication
All protected endpoints require user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Upon successful login, a token is issued and must be included in subsequent API requests.

Why Itâ€™s Important: Ensures that only verified users can access personal dashboards, make bookings, or manage properties, thus protecting private user data.

ðŸ›‚ Authorization
Role-based access control is enforced to restrict certain actions (e.g., only hosts can list properties, only guests can post reviews). Authorization checks validate that the authenticated user has permission to perform the requested action.

Why Itâ€™s Important: Prevents misuse of resources, such as unauthorized users editing or deleting property listings or accessing other usersâ€™ bookings.

ðŸš¦ Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is applied to API endpoints to prevent abuse (e.g., brute-force login attempts or denial-of-service attacks). Users are restricted to a reasonable number of requests within a set time frame.

Why Itâ€™s Important: Protects the platform from performance degradation and security threats caused by excessive or malicious API calls.

ðŸ§¼ Input Validation & Sanitization
All input from users is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Why Itâ€™s Important: Ensures data integrity and shields the application from common vulnerabilities that can compromise the database or frontend.

ðŸ”’ Secure Payment Handling
Payment-related APIs are secured using HTTPS and tokenized transactions with third-party providers (e.g., Stripe). Sensitive financial data is never stored directly.

Why Itâ€™s Important: Builds user trust and ensures compliance with financial data protection standards while preventing payment fraud or leaks.

 CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential practices in modern software development that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code.

ðŸš€ What is CI/CD?
CI (Continuous Integration): Automatically runs tests and builds the project every time a change is pushed to the repository. This ensures that new code integrates smoothly with the existing codebase.

CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery): Automates the deployment of tested code to production or staging environments, allowing for faster and more reliable releases.

Why Itâ€™s Important: CI/CD improves developer productivity, reduces bugs, ensures consistent deployments, and allows for quicker feature deliveryâ€”all of which are critical for a dynamic project like the Airbnb Clone.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
GitHub Actions: Automates CI/CD workflows, including linting, testing, and deployment upon each push or pull request.

Docker: Containerizes the application for consistent deployment across environments.

Heroku / Vercel / Netlify (optional): Can be used for easy deployment of backend or frontend services.

Postman/Newman (optional): For automated API testing as part of the CI pipeline.
